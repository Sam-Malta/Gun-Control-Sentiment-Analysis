He had a Class G license, which is similar to a guard card here in CA. He went though multiple background checks, and could carry even where other Floridians could not. He was interviewed by the FBI twice, and was not considered a threat. He had known contact with a suicide bomber. We don't know his wife's background. The firearms were purchased legally according to the ATF. He had placed a 911 call pledging elegance to ISIS. ISIS has claimed responsibility. It appears he was in a shoot out with the police prior to running into the night club. He went under more scrutiny that most and was not stopped. You can not blame this on lack of gun laws.",559,0
